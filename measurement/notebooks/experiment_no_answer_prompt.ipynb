    "**Background:**\n",
    "LLM prompt is told: 'If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know.' to help prevent hallucinations when context does not provide an answer.  It would be helpful to understand how effective prompt is at preventing responses when no context answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test Approach**\n",
    "A sample of questions will be selected from QA corpus where answer is not possible.  LLM will be asked question with most relevant possible context but with expectation that context does not provide actual answer.  Assessment will measure what % of responses accurately indicate the LLM doesn't know.\n"
