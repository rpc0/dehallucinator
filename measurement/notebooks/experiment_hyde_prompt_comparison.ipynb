    "**Background:**\n",
    "HYDE (Hypothetical Document Embedding) is an approach that has been indicated to improve the relevancy and comprehensiveness of RAG context retrieval by expanding a provided query prompt into a hypothetical document that can be used for context retrieval.  Different formulations of prompts may impact LLM response time and resulting embeddings.\n",

    "**Test Approach**\n",
    "A sample of questions will be selected from QA corpus.  Documents will be retrieved using 2 different prompts.  REesults from prompts 1, 2, and no-prompt will be compared via cosine similarity distance.\n"
