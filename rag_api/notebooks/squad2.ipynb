The Soviets had detonated their first nuclear bomb in September 1949; American soldiers had fully withdrawn from Korea; the Americans had not intervened to stop the communist victory in China, and Stalin calculated that the Americans would be even less willing to fight in Korea—which had seemingly much less strategic significance. The Soviets had also cracked the codes used by the US to communicate with the US embassy in Moscow, and reading these dispatches convinced Stalin that Korea did not have the importance to the US that would warrant a nuclear confrontation. Stalin began a more aggressive strategy in Asia based on these developments, including promising economic and military aid to China through the Sino–Soviet Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance Treaty.\\', \\'twwww\\': \\'Korean War, Stalin Stalin situation Soviets soldiers Americans Stalin Stalin Americans Soviets Stalin Korea Stalin Stalin, spring situation bomb soldiers victory significance codes embassy dispatches Stalin importance confrontation strategy developments aid, Korea China Korea Moscow Korea Asia China, spring 1950 September 1949\\'}\", \\'id: 454303133564142275, distance: 0.09123817831277847, entity: {\\\\\\'mindex\\\\\\': 454303133564142275, \\\\\\'id\\\\\\': \\\\\\'5733c3c7d058e614000b61f0\\\\\\', \\\\\\'context\\\\\\': \\\\\\'The judges continue in paragraph 12, \"The determination of when the targeted part is substantial enough to meet this requirement may involve a number of considerations.
